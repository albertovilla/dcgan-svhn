# dcgan-svhn
The goal of the project is to create a DCGAN that can generate new, realistic-looking images of house numbers. For that the following will be implemented:

- Load in and pre-process the house numbers dataset
- Define discriminator and generator networks
- Train these adversarial networks
- Visualize the loss over time and some sample, generated images
